# Random Password Generator

## Description

A random password generator that creates random passwords for users. It allows users to select which requirements their password has — uppercase, lowercase, special characters and numbers — and will generate a random password that takes these requirements into account.

This project was focused on learning the basics of Javascript, including variables, functions, conditional statements, and using logical operators. It helped to build our skills in reading and understanding JavaScript and to help foster logical thinking. 

This was my first foray into the world of JavaScript and I found it incredibly challenging. For me, the most challenging aspects were the logical thinking and understanding how to write the code to execute what I wanted. I also learned that with coding, we need to be exact in order for the program to properly understand what we want it to execute.
I also generally find mathematics a little harder to grasp, so all of the stuff with random number generation was especially tricky.
And finally, I learned how one pesky misplaced semi-colon can prevent the entire thing from not working as expected!
